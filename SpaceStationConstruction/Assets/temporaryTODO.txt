goal 27.10.2018-_____ ------------- full gameplay.

goal 27.10.2018-_____ ------------- functional prototype2
play through the whole thing with quests, and functioning
building, and mechanics.
Done:
build paths, as a civ build tree.(json readed for quest info)
be able to pick a path of 5-10 quests.
turret have 2 modes. swap between them. click button or qwe.

4 enemy classes, 
drone(super small, fast), 
craft(small, fast, shield, guns), 
medium ship(medium size, armor, shield, guns), 
capital(slow, big, heavy, shields, armor)

temporary waves for all quests. kinda sucks to waste effort on it.
also check for wave making optimizations. maybe an editor.

mark every type of code that would have to be changed to work for 3d

Active:
build different turrets
3 turret types(
(multiple)anti drone/antifighter, 
(singular, mixed)chain detonation by size/homing(detonates/disables engines)
(laser)(piercing)antiarmor /antishield pierce).
)

Todo:
to 3d
stuff?

goal --- fully functional prototype with minimal gameplay of 10 minutes.
- including, buidling, enemy waves and units, ally turrets, addons, modules, 
quests.
test spawning of units, in a large square wave ok
    then add turrets, with shots, tracking enemies ok
    then enemy units that attack ok
    then modules ok
    then outline a 5 step quest, for modules. skip
    then add instalations(build ok +effect skip)
    add science tree with 5 items -- optional skip
    add save progress skip

how do i build an addon? maybe have sprite settings, and effect.
effects aren't defined atm, and are optional.

Goal: testing gameplay... what can i do with this?
hp bars
upgrades for specific parts
barriers(reflectors)
slow a bit
then outline a 5 step quest, for modules.

nested prefabs template
temporary object, replaced with a pref on runtime.
Also adds a nice control over how the stuff is added.
--------------------

1 cycle.
NOTE: as far as quests go... do they decide the build path, or
content amount?

to 3d.

2. cycles.
figure out the mechanics completly. first complete, playable prototype.


3. cycles.
reiterate.
artist.

4. cycle
look into publishing and releases... ads.
