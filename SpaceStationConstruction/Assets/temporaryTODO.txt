goal --- fully functional prototype with minimal gameplay
- including, buidling, enemy waves and units, ally turrets, addons, modules, 
quests.
test spawning of units, in a large square wave ok
    then add turrets, with shots, tracking enemies ok
    then enemy units that attack ok
    then modules ok
    then outline a 5 step quest, for modules. skip
    then add instalations(build ok +effect skip)
    add science tree with 5 items -- optional skip
    add save progress skip

how do i build an addon? maybe have sprite settings, and effect.
effects aren't defined atm, and are optional.

Goal: testing gameplay... what can i do with this?
hp bars
upgrades for specific parts
barriers(reflectors)
slow a bit
then outline a 5 step quest, for modules.

nested prefabs template
temporary object, replaced with a pref on runtime.
Also adds a nice control over how the stuff is added.


1 cycle.
NOTE: as far as quests go... do they decide the build path, or
content amount?

modules cycle > load quest+ui > start button > execute quest 
> end quest(get results)
light, medium, heavy fighter... for now.
quest variations: figure those out. just have a 5 build step quest line
for now.
fast main menu
money or materials drop from enemies.
to 3d.

2. cycles.
figure out the mechanics completly. first complete, playable prototype.


3. cycles.
